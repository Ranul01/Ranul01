- âš¡ Fun fact: Did you know that the term "bug" to describe a software defect has an interesting origin? On September 9, 1947, Grace Hopper, a computer scientist, found an actual moth causing issues in the Harvard Mark II computer. She taped the moth into the logbook with the note: "First actual case of bug being found." This is the earliest known instance of a literal "bug" in a computer, and the term has been used to describe software and hardware issues ever since!
